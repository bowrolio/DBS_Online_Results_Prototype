  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Sharing your DBS Online Result</h1>
  <p>You can use this part of the service to share your result with someone else, like your employer.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How this works</h2>    
  <p>After you tell us who you are sharing your result with, you will be able to generate a one-time share code. When you generate the share code, we will send you an email with:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>full instructions</li>
    <li>the last 6 digits of your certificate number</li>
    <li>a link to access your result</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The person you send these to will be able to use them to view your result.</p>

  {{ govukButton({
    isStartButton: true,
  text: "Start sharing your result",
  href: "/tab-view-2-share-org#share-result"
  }) }}
