        <p>You can use this part of the service to share your result with someone else, like your employer.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How this works</h2>
        <p>After you tell us who you are sharing your result with, you will be able to generate a one-time share code. When you
          generate the share code, we will send you an email with:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>full instructions</li>
          <li>the last 6 digits of your certificate number</li>
          <li>a link to access your result</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The person you send these to will be able to use them to view your result.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The person you share your Online Result with can also download a receipt to prove they have viewed
          your result.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The receipt includes:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your name</li>
          <li>your position - for example, teacher</li>
          <li>your DBS certificate number and date of issue</li>
          <li>if your check is standard or enhanced and the workforce it is for</li>
          <li>if any barred lists were checked</li>
          <li>the date they viewed your online result</li>
