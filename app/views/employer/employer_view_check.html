      <p>You can use this service to view someone’s DBS Online Result</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you will need</h2>
      <p>To use this service you will need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the applicant's one-time share code</li>
        <li>the last six digits of the applicant's certificate number</li>
      </ul>

      {% from "govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "You can only use the share code once and you must use it within 21 days."
}) }}

<p>If you need to view the result again you will have to ask the applicant for another share code.</p>

<p>We will let the applicant know when you have viewed their result.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need proof that you have viewed a DBS Online Result</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">This service will also allow you to download a PDF receipt as proof you have viewed an applicant's Online Result.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The receipt includes:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>their name</li>
  <li>the post applied for - for example, teacher</li>
  <li>their DBS certificate number and date of issue</li>
  <li>if the check is standard or enhanced and the workforce it is for</li>
  <li>if any barred lists were checked</li>
  <li>the date you viewed the online result</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The receipt contains information from the applicant's DBS certificate. If you download a copy, you must follow your organisation's policy on the storage, handling, use, retention and disposal of DBS certificate information.</p>
