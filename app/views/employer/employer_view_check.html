      <p>To use this service you will need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the applicant's one-time share code</li>
        <li>the last six digits of the applicant's certificate number</li>
      </ul>

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "You can only use the share code once and you must use it within 21 days."
}) }}

<p>If you need to view the result again you will have to ask the applicant for another share code.</p>

<p>We will let the applicant know when you have viewed their result.</p>
