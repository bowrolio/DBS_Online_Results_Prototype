      <p>Dear Bill Carr,</p>

      <p>Application reference number: E0123456789</p>

      <p>You can share your DBS Online Result with someone else, like an employer. Your DBS Online Result contains highly sensitive personal information. You should be sure about who you are allowing to view your DBS Online Result before you share it with them.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Use a share code</h3>
      <p>You need to give them:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a share code</li>
        <li>the last six digits of your certificate number ******334455</li>
        <li>the web link: <a href="/employer_view_check"> https://dbs-or-alpha.herokuapp.com/employer_view_check</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can forward this email to them but it is important to send the share code separately. For example, by phone. You can only use the share code once and it must be used within 21 days.</p>

      <p>They need to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>select the web link: <a href="/employer_view_check"> https://dbs-or-alpha.herokuapp.com/employer_view_check</a></li>
        <li>copy and paste the last six digits of your certificate number and share code into the right sections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We let applicants know when their DBS Online Result has been viewed. A share code can only be used once and must be used within 21 days. Applicants can get a new share code if their DBS Online Result needs to be viewed again.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cancel a share code</h3>
      <p>You can cancel a share code if it hasn’t expired or been used. Log back in and select ‘Cancel’ for the code on the ‘Manage Share Codes’ tab.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact DBS</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, contact DBS:</p>
