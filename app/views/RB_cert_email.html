      <p>Dear Bill Carr,</p>

      <p class="govuk-heading-s">Application reference number: E0123456789</p>

      <p>You can share your DBS Online Result with someone else, like an employer. Your DBS online result contains sensitive personal information. You should be sure who is viewing your result before you share it.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing your result</h3>
      <p>To share your result with someone else they will need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a share code</li>
        <li>the last six digits of your certificate number: 176560</li>
        <li>The result link</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can forward this email to them but you must send the share code separately. For example, by phone. You can only use the share code once and it must be used within 21 days. You can get a new share code if your result needs to be viewed again.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Viewing your result</h3>
      <p>To view your result, the person with the share code will need to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="/employer/employer_view_check">go to the DBS online result service</a></li>
        <li>enter the share code and the last six digits of your certificate number into the right sections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will let you know when your result has been viewed.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cancel a share code</h3>
      <p>You can cancel a share code if it has not expired or been used. To do this you must <a href="/start">sign in again</a> and select ‘Cancel’ for the code on the ‘Manage share codes’ tab.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact DBS</h2>
